* MICrONS Project

Note that bossDB, the serverless technology, was used in all three Phases.

  Each phase ends with an information processing challenge that assesses
  how well the new algorithms perform on increasingly challenging
  machine learning tasks: similarity discrimination in Phase 1,
  generalization and classification in Phase 2, and invariant
  recognition in Phase 3. Performers use the results of their
  experiments in each phase to guide their development of improved
  algorithms in the subsequent phase (in Phase 1, performers base their
  algorithms on the existing neuroscience literature).
  
  The MICrONS program comprises three Technical Areas (TAs):
  
  TA1 
  – experimental design, theoretical neuroscience, computational
    neural modeling, machine learning, neurophysiological data collection,
    and data analysis;
  
  TA2 
  – neuroanatomical data collection; and
  
  TA3 
  – reconstruction of cortical circuits from neuroanatomical data
    and development of information technology systems to store, align, and
    access neural circuit reconstructions with the associated
    neurophysiological and neuroanatomical data.

** Future: Reconstructions atop bossDB

It is not yet known how Seung Lab produced the reconstructed. 
Suspects: [[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow][Chunkflow]], [[https://github.com/seung-lab/igneous][Igneous]], [[https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume][cloud-volume]], [[https://github.com/seung-lab/kimimaro][kimimaro]], etc.

It is a goal of Reconstrue Cuboids to merge some appropriate
reconstruction code with bossDB.
