* Abstract

This document proposes refresh modifications and novel extensions to
the bossDB volumetric database. The envisioned platform has been
given the working title of Cuboids.

During the MICrONS program, the bossDB (a.k.a., "the Boss") code has
proven to scale to petabytes of data. It is unusual for a codebase to
be so extremely stress tested during its initial deployment. Although its
serverless core is solid, in order to position the Boss as the open
source backend for the next generation of neuroscientific microscopy,
the codebase can be streamlined for ease of administration and to
address feedback from the original users.

The initial goal of the Cuboids project is an architectural update of
bossDB to leverage the latest AWS serverless innovations and
various supporting fully managed services thereby simplifying deployment and
maintenance of the existing system. This update is to jigger the Boss
internals yet maintain the existing bossDB surface APIs.

The subsequent goal is to use the streamlined bossDB as the repository
component of a cloud service which can do more than just store and
visualize data. The resulting Cuboids platform is to be a "whole
product" which recapitulates the multi-system architecture of the
MICrONS project but with all processes -- storage, analysis,
visualization, et cetera -- occuring within a Cuboids instance rather
than being spread across multiple systems. New functionality is to
be implemented in a serverless-first fashion in order to have the entire
machine be able to scale massively and perform at high speed.

The first process to be moved into Cuboids is reconstruction of
neurons via image recognition machine learning inference. After that
the system will be an agile platform for further microscopy analysis
processes. Examples include reconstruction inference using algorithms
such as Google's Flood Filling Networks, classification of neurons by
cell type, and -- more complex than the relatively simpler task of
inference -- the actual training of machine learning models on
volumetric data.

* Introduction

The [[https://bossdb.org/][bossDB]] is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering][volumetric]] database capable of storing petabytes of
data generated from microscopic imaging of neurological
tissue. Colloquially, bossDB is also known as "the Boss" and in this
document both terms are interchangeable. 

Initial development of the Boss was funded by grants from [[https://www.iarpa.gov/][IARPA]] under
[[https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/microns][the MICrONS project]]. The resulting source code -- spanning multiple
repositories -- is available under the [[https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0][Apache 2.0]] open source license.

The modified bossDB codebase proposed herein is designed to be the
repository component of a platform which has been given the working
title of Cuboids. Cuboids builds atop the existing work by doubling down
on the current AWS lock-in of bossDB, in the interests of streamlining
the architecture in order to make it easier to administer. This part
of the proposal is simply "better, faster, cheaper" thinking which
does not change the high-level feature set of the repository.

The original bossDB codebase evidences a valid and shrewd
architectural style which values vendor neutral open source. Yet to
deal with the sporadic velocity and massive volume of data being thrown
off by electron microscopes, an AWS serverless engine was inserted within
the vendor neutral codebase. This worked well but resulted in a mixed
architectural style.

The Boss preprint addresses the obvious concerns raised by this:
#+begin_quote
When considering a cloud-native approach, vendor lock-in is one
potential concern â€“ as we not only use the AWS cloud to deploy bossDB,
but have integrated many of its services into the system to
substantially accelerate development and performance.  To minimize the
development impact of expanding to an additional cloud provider or
on-premise cluster, future work is needed to create a layer of
abstraction between the core software and AWS services.
#+end_quote

*The core value proposition of this manifesto* is a realpolitik
recognition that, although such concerns are valid, by accepting
vendor lock-in the architecture can be simplified and the rate of
progress can be increased. Cuboids aims to resolve the complexity of
the mixed architectural style by not fretting about AWS lock-in and
jettisoning any existing components which can be replaced by
equivalent fully managed AWS services.

Beyond the aforementioned architectural refresh, Cuboids aims to build
significant analysis functionality as close as possible to the
repository. Given the current architecture of the Boss, image analysis
has to be performed by separate external systems, requiring the
transfer of mountains of data. Cuboids builds on the previous bossDB
work such that analysis of the data within a bossDB repository can be
performed close to where the data resides.

This functional expansion can be accomplished by shepherding the
existing serverless boosted architecture towards a serverless-first
design. In 2015, when work on the Boss was started, a serverless-first
architecture simply could not be built because AWS has not yet built
out enough serverless products. The term "serverless-first" refers in
part to the minimizing of self-managed services. More importantly, the
balance is to swing from the current Boss architecture of a
non-serverless frame with a serverless engine to one which builds out
from the serverless core and then adds on long running, self-managed
compute instances only as necessitated by technical or financial
concerns.

Peta-scale datasets are unlikely to ever migrate from where they are
initially reposited. Recognizing this and the fact that the existing
AWS-only codebase is currently managing petabytes of data in AWS, this
manifesto accepts the reality of single vendor lock-in with regards to
cloud provider platform and so drinks deeply from the AWS Kool-Aid
pitcher by moving towards less servers and more fully managed
services.

* The history of the Boss

The Boss was written to be the repository for data generated by the
MICrONS program. The data consists of videos, static images, and the
results of machine learning based analysis of the movies and images.

The funding came out of IARPA. The code is open source and [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb/blob/master/LICENSE.md][licensed]] in
a commercially friendly manner, that is under the Apache 2.0
license. The codebase was [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss/graphs/contributors][initiated in 2015]] and development has
continued (e.g. usage throttling was added in late 2019).

** The MICrONS program

In the interest of brevity, MICrONS is expounded upon only minimally in
this document. See the companion document, the MICrONS Program
Primer, for more details.

Tersely, the Boss -- created by JHU/APL -- was used in both Phase One
and Phase Two of MICrONS. Phase One was a "small" trail run of the
main task which occurred in Phase Two. The resulting EM image sets
were 40 terabyte and 2.5 petabyte, respectively, a ratio of
1:62. Phase One involved three separate groups of organizations
competitively trying out to be awarded the grant for the Phase Two
work.  The winning team which moved on to Phase Two consisted of
[[https://alleninstitute.org/][The Allen Institute]], [[https://seunglab.org/][the Seung Lab at Princeton University]], and
[[https://toliaslab.org/][the Tolias Lab]] at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.

The technical architecture of the data system of the MICrONS project
centers around the Boss. The design enabled coordination across the
organizations participating in MICrONS.  The following diagram
illustrates part of the flow of data in and out of the Boss repository
during Phase Two.

#+attr_html: :width 65%
[[./images/microns_phase_two_dataflow.jpg]]

Four organization each focused on their particular area of expertise:
- JHU/APL wrote the Boss repository code and supporting tools
- Baylor University performed functional imaging experiments on a live mouse
- The Allen Institute electron microscope (EM) scanned that mouse's brain
- The Seung Lab wrote the machine learning code to reconstruct the imaged neurons

The functional calcium imaging generated many 4D movies of neural
activities taken while the mouse was performing in various learning
experiments.  Next the structural imaging involved scanning a cubic
millimeter of the mouse's brain via an industrialized EM workflow which
generated 2.5 petabyte of TIFF image files. (The distinction between
structural imaging and functional imaging is analogous to that between
the map of a road network and recordings of traffic over the network,
respectively.) Finally, the reconstruction work involved downloading
the EM images and mining them via custom built machine learning
algorithms -- deep CNNs navigating through massive volumes of 3D data
to recognize neurons down to individual synapses. (Not shown here is
the work of co-registering the functional calcium videos to the EM
structural data.)

such reconstruction algorithms do. The colored map on the 2D plane
slice is the output of a segmentation algorithm, an intermediate
product of the full reconstruction process.

** The Boss technical architecture

The preprint describe the Boss as:
#+begin_quote
The Boss is a large-scale spatial database service for storing
multi-dimensional neuroimaging data and associated voxel annotations
that was created for the IARPA MICrONS program. The database is
designed to support three dimensional, multi-channel, and time series
source data and annotations at various bit depths. The Boss was
designed to live in the cloud and has a tiered storage architecture to
balance cost and performance, auto-scaling capabilities, and a
high-bandwidth ingest process.
#+end_quote   
   
In close collaboration with AWS, JHU/APL's coders built out a solid
serverless architecture for the Boss. The complication was that this
collaboration happened in 2015, a time when many support services for
serverless had not yet been built out by AWS. Therefore, various
non-serverless self-managed services were stood up to complete the
Boss. This resulted in a hybrid architecture. Nonetheless, a well
structured architecture enables individual components to be modified over
time.
   
In its current form the Boss architecture can be considered a hybrid
of two styles. The foundational frame consists of non-serverless,
platform neutral, open source machinery originally assembled for the
NeuroData project. The JHU/APL developers were already familiar with
these solid technologies and it made sense to reapply them in the Boss
codebase. Within that frame was built out a turbo boosted engine of
serverless tech. These decisions were made for valid reasons back in
2015 and time has shown the resulting codebase has served its original
purpose well.

The following diagram is from the original bossDB preprint. In order
to break it down, the yellow and red background boxes with labels in
bold have been added as annotations. The yellow box highlights the
serverless core of the architecture.  The red boxes define three
non-serverless sub-systems which were built out of platform neutral,
open source machinery. The colors were chosen to correspond to the
argument presented in later sections: keep the yellow, jettison the
red.

#+attr_html: :width 75%
[[./images/bossdb_delta_components.png]]

The core engine of BossDB is the spatial database, the code for which
is in the repository [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb][jhuapl-boss/spdb]]. This service features the usual
suspects found in AWS serverless machines: Lambda, S3, SQS, DynamoDB,
Step Functions, etc.


The other three sub-systems in red are proven non-serverless, open
source technologies: Bastion, Vault, Keycloak, etc.
- The upper left red zone is the REST interface
- The Single Sign-on subsystem is in the upper right red zone
- The lower red zone can be replace with AWS Secrets Manager

Those three sub-systems are not particularly interesting, domain
specific machinery. Nonetheless, the functionality they provide
amounts to table stakes for a modern, mature application. In AWS
marketing terminology they are [[https://jeremybower.com/articles/undifferentiated-heavy-lifting-2-0.html]["undifferentiated heavy lifting"]]
support machinery. JHU/APL simply reapplied solid codebases they were
already familiar with while getting on with the task of building a
petascale volumetric spatial database.

Sundry adopted AWS services are enumerated in the bottom dash boxed
region. These services are applicable to both serverless and container
based architectures and will be kept in Cuboids.

Note: the hybrid nature of the Boss architecture is not a result of
the multi-team social structure of the MICrONS program. On the other
hand, the fact that the original Boss cannot perform image recognition
internally is indeed a reflection of the social structure. The
decisions which lead to this state can be seen as a wisely chosen
limiting of the scope of development for the initial Boss. But, as
will be argued herein, it is time to change that.

From an external perspective, the resulting architectural structure is
still sound. Cuboids will maintain the existing Boss HTTP APIs to the
repository component and only modify its internal structure. Thereby
analysis tools written atop Cuboids will be able to interface with
multiple bossDB repositories, including the one wherein the MICrONS
data resides.

For more on the Boss, see the two preprints and two talks by Dean
Kleissas. Both the later preprint and later talk are more informative
than the earlier versions. All can be found via [[*References][the References
section]].  The place to start is [[https://youtu.be/ldNqVmW9c98?t=398][Kleissas' fifty minute talk at AWS
re:Invent 2017]]/, which is all about the Boss and also a well done talk
high production value, partially because the nature of the data is
more visually entertaining than many that in many an AWS talk.

* Realtechnik of cloud architecting

Significant but non-core parts of the bossDB codebase (the red boxes
in the previous diagram) are simply deployments of existing open
source components which just so happens to be platform neutral,
non-serverless tech. Vendor neutrality is a good thing but Cuboids
consciously jettisons that feature in the interests of accelerating
innovation via improved developer velocity and reduced devops
workload. Perfectly good open-source component of the Boss will be
replaced with equivalent AWS fully managed services.

This document is entitled "The Cuboids Manifesto" in reference to the
"[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1AiBi5gf1s][manifesto]]" documents that circulate within the Swift programming
community (as well as acknowledging that this document is a bit
long). A Swift manifesto serves to introduce a proposal which is
larger in scope than a single, small, specific idea. This document
follows that lighthearted nomenclature, in order to highlight that
there is a [[https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/08/16/realtechnik-nausea-and-technological-longing/][realtechnik]] "philosophy" driving the decisions behind what
is proposed herein.

There are two main assumptions to the argument:
- The original Boss codebase can only be deployed on AWS
- Very large datasets (in particular, the MICrONS data on AWS) are rather immobile

As to the former assumption, normally it is ideal if open source code
is platform vendor neutral. Yet falling short of such ideals there are
still benefits to the open source way, for example, innovation shared
throughout a community of users. The Boss, given its AWS serverless
engine, is very much not vendor neutral.  For example, the Boss makes
use of AWS Step Functions. Unfortunately there is currently no
equivalent abstraction available which works on other cloud platforms
(which seems odd but c'est la vie).

Given the AWS technologies already adopted in the bossDB codebase,
Cuboids accepts and runs with the reality of AWS lock-in, probably in
perpetuity. It is arguably a bit perverse for open source to be tuned
up just for a single commercial cloud platform, but the hypothesis
herein is that by doing so it will make it much easier for other
organizations to deploy BossDB, thereby speeding up the diffusion of
innovation.

The latter assumption acknowledges the inertia of peta-scale
datasets. The MICrONS data is already in AWS S3. Other smaller
datasets are also accreting in Boss deploys on AWS. So code
which analyzes these datasets yet only runs on AWS is not a major
negative. Of course, this too is gradually leading to more AWS lock
in. Other cloud vendors are missing out on an emerging industry
sector. Obviously it is not the biggest sector in terms of users but this
is heading towards exo-scale datasets which is not insignificant.

Datasets on such a scale as that of the MICrONS data form a
gravitational well inducing system architectures wherein data
processing happens as close to the data as possible; it is desirable
to minimize massive data transfers. Although the existing bossDB APIs
can be used to fetch raw data for analysis on systems external to the
Boss, Cuboids intends to extend the Boss platform such that data
analysis can be performed within the system. Quoting Francis Bacon:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mahomet cald the Hill to come to him. And when the Hill stood still,
he was neuer a whit abashed, but said; If the Hill will not come to
Mahomet, Mahomet wil go to the hil. [sic]
#+END_QUOTE

#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[./images/mohammed_and_the_mountain.jpg]]

The two above assumptions drive the logic of this document. This
proposal argues to dive headlong down the slippery slope of AWS
lock-in. This recommended direction may seem counterintuitive and even
distasteful given the platform vendor neutral, open source ecosystem
out of which the Boss grew. Nonetheless, although the technological
lead which AWS currently enjoys over the other cloud platform vendors
[[https://cloudwars.co/amazon/inside-amazon-aws-no-longer-jeff-bezos-growth-engine/][is slipping]], it does not appear that a cross-platform serverless
version of bossDB is possible at this time, given the state of those
cloud platform offerings competing with AWS (e.g. a lack of an AWS
Step Functions equivalent for Google Cloud Platform).

Therefore, it is argued herein that the mixed architecture is
retarding the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations][diffusion of innovation]], especially with regards to that
theory's criteria of "complexity" and "trialability." So, perhaps we
should just accept that this codebase will always be locked in to AWS
and drink their Kool Aid in order to lighten the load.

As a reality check on this AWS serverless enthusiasm, there is a
decent 2020-10 article, [[https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-stalled/][Why the Serverless Revolution Has Stalled]],
which enumerates situations where serverless is not yet living up to
its promise. The Boss as a use case of serverless technology actually
passes almost all the checkpoints enumerated in that article: for
example, all the code is written in Python (i.e. a language well
supported by AWS Lambda), it is greenfield, and the entire app was
explicitly designed to run on a cloud platform from the get go. The
single concern raised of which the Boss is guilty is vendor lock-in but
as argued herein, that is acknowledged and accepted.

So, the Cuboids code will be very locked to AWS as the vendor
platform, which is an ironic form of open source. Regardless, the
Cuboids codebase will remain open source, intentionally maintaining
the Apache 2.0 license in the hopes of building a community around
the codebase.

* Architectural updates

The first stage of Cuboids development is to be an architectural
refresh of the existing Boss codebase. 

The bossDB codebase was [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss/graphs/contributors][started in 2015]], which was early days for AWS
serverless, nevermind using such young technology to scale to
petabytes of data. In the interim, Lambda has become more
sophisticated and AWS has gotten around to providing
more fully managed services such as API Gateway, Cognito, and AWS
Secrets Manager. The life of a Boss administrator could involve less
hassles if the Boss were to adopt those innovations.

** Overview

The architectural refresh is motivated by abstract goals and those
resolve to a set of specific coding tasks.  The abstract goals are to
effect the following changes.

| Before                     | After                         |
|----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Hybrid architecture        | Serverless first architecture |
| Some self-managed services | More fully managed services   |
| Complex deployment         | Simplified deployment         |

The main goal of the architectural refresh is to reduce the complexity
resulting from the hybrid architecture by moving towards a
serverless-first architecture. Most of the specific coding tasks
revolve around replacing self-managed sub-systems with equivalent
fully managed AWS services. Simply keeping the current serverless core
architecture but rewriting those components which can be replaced with
equivalent AWS service will make bossDB easier to deploy and maintain.

Additionally, another potential benefit of removing self-managed
services is that serverless costs are variable while self-managed
services with constantly running servers have higher fixed
costs. Minimizing self-managed services can lead to lower costs,
depending on use case.

Note that the goals include *not* significantly modifying the features
of the Boss repository. Specifically, the surface RESTful APIs are to
maintain backward compatibility. Any distinctly novel functionality to
be introduced in Cuboids which is not present in the Boss codebase
will be constructed outside the Boss repository component.

The refurbishments to be performed can be illustrated by further
marking up the Boss high level architecture diagram from earlier.
These annotations are color coded according to a stop light
red-yellow-green color scheme. The red boxes are to be replaced with
the AWS services named in green. The red boxes are labeled by their
roles in black bold text. Those same roles are to be resatisfied with
the named (in green) AWS fully managed services.

#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[./images/boss_high_level_changes.png]]

In the above diagram, the parts of the architecture to be refurbished are:
- The RESTful interface machinery: to be handled by Amazon API Gateway
- The Single sign on machinery: to be migrated to AWS Cognito
- The secrets keeping machinery: to be replaced with AWS Secrets Manager
- The Redis cache: to be managed by Amazon ElastiCache

These sub-systems to be modified are simply necessary support
infrastructure -- undifferentiated, off-the-shelf app infrastructure,
not the bespoke domain specific innovations contained in the core serverless
engine of the spatial database. The code to be replaced is perfectly
good code; that is proven platform independent, scalable open
source. But as pre-serverless tech it requires self management and
related infrastructures.

Besides the above mentioned machinery refurbishments there is also a
tooling library, [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/heaviside][heaviside]], which is to be replaced with AWS
equivalent tooling, that is, the Python AWS CDK. Heaviside is another
instance of JHU/APL banging out a wheel before AWS got around to
recreating an equivalent. Heaviside does its job just fine but the
goal here is to set the Boss up for the next ten years. While in Rome
do as the Romans, and in AWS the CDK is the way to do what heaviside
does. AWS sees their CDKs as important tools. Might as well benefit
from the freely available tooling supported by AWS developer
resource.

In the following before-and-after juxtaposition diagram, the image on
the left is the raw image taken from the bossDB preprint, with the
serverless core highlighted in yellow. The image on the right is the
envisioned streamlined and serverless-first Boss. Notice how the
diagram reduces to a completely generic serverless architecture. That
clearly illustrates the argument being made here but reduces the
diagram to where it contains no specific detail. Going into such
detail is beyond the scope of this document, which is already overlong
as is.

#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[./images/arch_before_and_after.png]]

** Development roadmap

The very first development work will be to simply stand up a Boss
instance using the existing codebase. That will be useful for testing
backward compatibility. Surely the deployment experience will cause
refinements to what is proposed in this document. That deployment
experience will be documented. Perhaps logging that will prove useful
to other administrators of Boss deploys.

The root reason for going through all the following code refresh
hassles (without gaining any new functionality) is that the Boss has
proven itself. So, the more important reason for standing up a Boss
instance is to maintain continuity of value. An alternative
development roadmap could just take the Boss as proof that serverless
can scale well to the task at hand but conclude that the code is so
bit rotted that simply starting a new codebase from scratch is the
easiest way forward. 

This manifesto is not going for a codebase restart. Cuboids is going
for evolution, not revolution. Benefiting from the well formed
architecture of the Boss, these proposed changes have been broken out
into discrete tasks so that the envisioned benefits can be
accumulated in stages. This is to reduce the risk of the whole
Cuboids project going off into the weeds. So, development can proceed
as follows: refurbish a single component, test to ensure the whole
system still works, move on to the next task.

One way to test for compatibility is to have one test client which can
work with both the existing Boss and Cuboids simply by changing the
end-point URL.  The existing Boss integration test suites should prove
useful.

The following tasks are broken out into isolable chucks of work. Each
is to be tracked as a GitHub Issues Project. The Projects are to be
worked on individually sequentially so that overall progress can be
broken out to milestones, testable along the way via integration
tests.
   
** RESTful API

In the color coded architectural diagram, the RESTful API subsystem is
in the upper left red zone. The code for that Boss API machinery and
schema is currently in the repository named [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss][jhuapl-boss/boss]]. That
machinery is to be replaced with Amazon API Gateway. 

Currently, there is a cluster using nginx to run some Python. That
Python is a Django app using =rest_framework= to handle REST API calls
coming in over the public network. Cuboid volumes of data can come in
and go out, optionally being compressed to blosc, numpy, or npygz via
HTTP content negotiation (see [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss/blob/master/django/bossspatialdb/parsers.py][parsers.py]]).

API Gateway was originally created to provide HTTP interfaces to AWS
serverless apps. Since the Boss core is serverless it is only natural
to use API Gateway to implement the REST interface. This is an
instance of an undifferentiated component which the Boss needed but
for which there was no available AWS service at the time of initial
development of the Boss. (Actually it looks like API Gateway had just
been released at the time but was passed over. Perhaps there was a
design choice of localizing the platform dependent code to specific
repositories in the hope of someday porting the code to other cloud
platforms.)

There is some domain specific code in jhuapl-boss/boss, such as HTTP
content negotiation for cuboids. Such Python logic in the repo will be
migrated to Lambdas, but the Django on nginx foundation is to be
replaced by API Gateway.

It is a goal to maintain backwards compatibility of the interface with
the original Boss APIs. This refurbishment is purely about simplifying
the machinery which implements the interface, not about changing the
user experience of the interface.

** Single sign-on

Referring to the color coded architecture diagram again, the upper
right red zone is the single sign-on (SSO) service.  Notice the two
domains in the diagram: api.theboss.io and auth.theboss.io. Quoting
from the Boss preprint:
  #+begin_quote
  Our identity provider server intentionally runs independently from
  the rest of bossDB system, forcing the bossDB API to authenticate
  just like any other SSO integrated tool or application, and making
  future *federation with other data archives or authentication systems
  easy.*
  #+end_quote

Cuboids will maintain this architectural feature, that is, auth as a
separate microservice. This also means that this work can be done
completely independently of the other refurbishment tasks in this
section of the manifesto.

Returning to the Boss preprint:
  #+begin_quote
  We use the open source software package Keycloak as an identity
  provider to manage users and roles. We created a Django OpenID
  Connect plugin to simplify the integration of services with the SSO
  provider... The Keycloak server is deployed in an auto-scaling group
  that sits behind an Elastic Load Balancer.
  #+end_quote

In other words, another cluster of servers being self-managed. This
machinery can be replaced by Cognito and some support Lambdas. The
plan is to keep the same APIs but, in Cuboids, behind the Boss SSO APIs
will be API Gateway reading from, say, a Swagger file that mimics the Boss
auth APIs, and some Lambdas that are essentially a wrapper for AWS
Cognito API method calls.

This work can be done in stages. Could start with the existing
Keycloak based SSO code and do [[https://www.wolfe.id.au/2017/11/05/aws-user-federation-with-keycloak/][federation with AWS SAML]]. Any API Gateway
based auth can [[https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-aws-lambda-authorizers-with-a-third-party-identity-provider-to-secure-amazon-api-gateway-rest-apis/][treat the Boss SSO Keycloak service as a third party
identity provider]] (e.g., [[https://github.com/vzakharchenko/keycloak-lambda-authorizer][Keycloak adapter for AWS Lambda]]). Perhaps
such code exists already somewhere. Perhaps modify or use the code for
[[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-oidc][boss-oidc]].

In the docs for [[https://docs.theboss.io/docs/authentication][the Boss Auth REST APIs]], the Boss single sign on (SSO)
service has about 16 methods, comprising the usual suspects of sign on
APIs: CRUD operations for users, groups, resources, and
permissions. For example, "List User" via
https://api.theboss.io/v1/sso/user/:user_name

Note, existing OIDC Identity Providers (such as the one at
auth.bossdb.io with existing MICrONS data users) can be added to a
Cognito User Pool. This means Cuboids can recognize the existing
auth.bossdb.io users and can create Cognito user roles for their
activity while in Cuboids, say, running analysis on data in the
MICrONS Boss repository.

** Secrets

The lower red zone can be replaced with [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html][AWS Secrets Manager]]. The
existing machinery is more auto-scaling groups of EC2 instances:
- Vault servers maintain secrets
  - [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/configs/core.py#L138][Provisioned via CloudFormation]]
- Vault nodes store their encrypted info in Consul key/value store
  
This should be a pretty straightforward migration from two
self-managed services to an equivalent AWS fully managed
services. (Actually it looks like
[[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/configs/core.py#L131][Consul has already been replaced with DynamoDB]].)
There is a bespoke [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/lambda/monitors/chk_vault.py][~chk_vault~]] admin Lambda, the sort of thing
which can be jettisoned and replaced with AWS Console dashboards.

** Cache machinery

The above tasks involve migrating generic, support infrastructure
sub-systems from self-managed code to fully managed AWS
services. Those sub-systems are not part of the core serverless
engine. In contrast, refurbishing the cache machinery is a
modification to the serverless core i.e. the code in the spdb
repository. Nonetheless this task is another instance of streamlining
by migrating to fully managed services.
   
The Read/Write Cache is part of the core engine, enabling higher
performance. It is a Redis cache running on a cluster of EC2
instances. A cluster of self-managed EC2 instances is not
serverless. On the other hand, the cache is wired up to Lambdas which
sync (read and write) the data in the Redis in-memory cache with the
persistent store, S3. So if management of the Redis cluster were
delegated to [[https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/fully-managed-redis/][Amazon ElastiCache for Redis]], that would make spbd a
poster child for serverless. The cache manager is an EC2 instance. It
will be removed and its functionality subsumed into ElastiCache.

There will still be a Redis cluster with EC2 instances containing the
in-memory data but that will be auto scaling and fully managed by
ElastiCache. The goal is for any Redis machinery to be reduced to
CloudFormation configuration of supporting services used in a
serverless application.

AWS's variant of Redis provides integration with other
AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail,
and Amazon SNS. Such integrations can be useful if going all-in on
building out for AWS only.

The main code is in the [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb][jhuapl-boss/spdb]] repo. The most significant
files is [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb/blob/master/spdb/spatialdb/rediskvio.py][rediskvio.py]] which is all about using Redis as a cache for
cuboids. There is also [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb/blob/master/spdb/spatialdb/state.py][CacheStateDB class]]: "to implement the Boss
cache state database and associated functionality...Database is a
redis instance." The code that generates the CloudFormation for the
Redis cache machinery is in the boss-manage repository, in
[[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/configs/redis.py][cloudformation/configs/redis.py]].

** Infrastructure as code tooling

Finally, there is another technology of the Boss which will be replaced
with an equivalent AWS technology. Unlike the above tasks this is not
about services. Rather, JHU/APL's developer tool, heaviside, is to be
replaced with AWS CDK.
   
The core of the Boss is a sophisticated serverless application which
relies heavily on AWS Step Functions.  Actually writing Step Functions
in the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html][Amazon States Language]] -- raw JSON -- is an ugly hassle. To
address this inconvenience, JHU/APL created an infrastructure-as-code
tool they call [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/heaviside][heaviside]], a "Python library and DSL for working with
AWS Step Functions."

Heaviside is another example of JHU/APL (specifically, Derek Pryor)
inventing tech needed in order to sanely build AWS serverless
applications, in this case apps involving Step Functions.  Eventually AWS
got around to releasing their own equivalent technology, AWS CDK.

So, a decision presents itself: continue to build the core high level
logic of Boss internal processes atop a one-off tooling library by a
small team or take the hit of rewriting the existing heaviside code,
porting it to the now dominant standard tool, AWS CDK.  Migrating to
AWS CDK would position the Boss to reap the benefits of working with a
more mature implementation of a tech, one which is currently diffused
throughout a much larger community of developers and with the weight
of AWS support behind it.

The decision for Cuboids is to replace all existing heaviside code
with equivalent CDK code, then move forward atop the standard AWS
technology. AWS CDK is available for multiple programming
languages. The Boss is written in Python so it is only logical to use
the Python AWS CDK.

In the boss-manage repository, [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/tree/master/cloud_formation/stepfunctions][18 Step Functions]] already exist, written
to be "compiled" by heaviside. These are to be rewritten to use the
standard tool for such things: AWS CDK.

* Architectural extensions

The previous section enumerated various architectural updates which
together will position a streamlined Boss for broader diffusion of
innovation. Those refurbishments add almost no new functionality to
the Boss. In contrast, this section discusses novel machinery to be
deployed alongside a Boss repository. The conglomerate is to be called
Cuboids.

As argued above, for peta-scale datasets, it is desirable for the
compute of analysis to happen as close to the data as
possible. Cuboids does that by inserting the compute into the same
system as the core Boss repository, similar to how SQL databases have
stored procedures. Such machinery will be built a la serverless first
in the hopes of reducing impedance mismatches between serverless and
serverful components.

The existing eighteen Step Functions and various Lambdas currently in
the Boss can be seen as a library of code containing serverless
components which perform fundamental CRUD and visualization operations
on cuboids in a Boss repository, and do so utilizing a scalable
in-memory cache.  Analysis programs which run close to the data can be
built atop those base operators. The Boss Downsampler is a good
example of a program written atop this library.

The platform is already there but it has not yet been exploited to the
level where non-trivial data pipelines have been built atop
it. Cuboids is laying the foundation for more interesting pipelines
to be built within a Boss deploy.

This section has two parts: first is an explanation of the design
pattern, serverless-first, which will guide the construction of new
components in Cuboids. Then the serverless-first design pattern is put
to use to add neuron reconstruction machinery to Cuboids. Doing so
will set Cuboids on a path to be more of a "whole product" for
microscopy workflows beyond essentially just a repository accessed by
external analysis tools.

** Serverless-first design pattern

The core design innovation of Cuboids is that the Boss architecture is
being refined and elaborated in a serverless-first fashion. This
section explains what is meant by that.

Obviously from previous sections, part of the serverless-first mindset
involves simply minimizing any self-managed infrastructure. Of course,
one must keep an eye on the costs. Serverless can be quite cost effective
but when it comes to fully managed services (for serverless or not),
sometimes AWS wants way too much money in return for simply removing a
hassle.
   
Setting aside services, from a coder's perspective the main AWS
service that enables serverless-first designs is Step Functions, which
has already been adopted into the Boss machinery. There are already at
least [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/tree/master/cloud_formation/stepfunctions][18 Step Functions]] in the Boss codebase. For example, the
Downsample service involves [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/stepfunctions/resolution_hierarchy.hsd][a Step Function]] with an Activity which is
a trivial wrapper for [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-tools/blob/master/activities/resolution_hierarchy.py][the core code]].

Step Functions are programs -- programs that just so happen to have
explicitly defined state machines. Step Functions bring state to
serverless apps which are based on the innately stateless AWS Lambda
service. Any state which needs to bridge across both serverless and
non-serverless processes is maintained in a Step Function. The states
-- as Lambdas and Activities -- are the program modules which get
assembled into Step Functions based programs. 

Note that "serverless-first" does not exclude non-serverless
processes. Step Functions can orchestrate both types. Step Functions
can invoke serverless Lambdas, and other non-serverless processes can
interact with Step Functions as Activity workers performing
Tasks. From a Step Function's perspective, the former are "pushed to"
and the latter "pull from." This means that Step Functions based
services can benefit from massively scalable serverless tech as
implemented by AWS Lambdas yet also work with legacy code and/or
processes which are too big or long running to be executed within AWS
Lambda. 

Another rarely mentioned valuable feature of the serverless-first
design pattern is that it allows for safety valves. The goal of
serverless-first is to build out as much as can be in a serverless
fashion based on Lambdas, but failing that various non-serverless
components can be added into a Step Function as needed. In such cases
it is the same Step Function program, but with some state transitions driven
by EC2 instances acting as Task Activities, rather than all states
being implemented as Lambdas.

At a certain level of traffic, for purely financial reasons it may be
worth switching the compute from Lambda to EC2. For normal serverless
applications, those sorts of economics start to be financially worth
considering when scale gets in the range of ten million monthly hits. But the
Boss is not a normal serverless application. The Boss is not primarily
benefiting from serverless similar to how a small start-up
might. Sure, low fixed costs are nice but the core value of serverless
for the Boss is its ability to scale massively to the demands of large
neuroscience experiments.

From the Boss codebase, it may not be obvious that Step Functions can
orchestrate both serverless and server-based compute. Yet dig around
in the source and it turns out that although the Boss Step Functions
deal primarily with Lambdas, there are long running processes as task
Activities. 

There are two perspectives from which the Boss can be seen as
something to build upon. From an external perspective, analysis
programs can be built which call on [[https://docs.theboss.io/docs][the Boss REST APIs]]. For example,
that is what was done by the labs involved in the MICrONS
program. From an internal perspective, programs can be built as Step
Functions which orchestrate Lambda and EC2 based components (the
latter includes Docker containers). Currently some of the Step
Functions are available for use via the external REST APIs. New
functionality added within Cuboids will build upon the internal
libraries via the private APIs i.e. the interfaces to the existing
core Boss Lambdas and Step Functions.

Consider the case of adding cuboid segmentation functionality. To the
outside world the service will manifest as new methods added to the
REST APIs. Inside AWS, The HTTP messages containing REST requests
will be handled by AWS API Gateway (APIGW) which will initiate a Step
Function instance to run a segmentation job. Some states will be
Lambdas; some states might be long running Activities, say, EC2
instances running chunkflow processes.

Following the serverless-first design pattern, Cuboids will continue
to build more Step Functions based programs that run within the
platform.  Any new Step Functions based code will not use heaviside,
rather it will be written using the Python AWS CDK. This does
not mean that removing heaviside from the codebase is a prerequisite to such
novel processes. CDK can live peaceably alongside heaviside.

** Reconstruction: serverless CNN inference

The first major functional extension to be added to Cuboids is
reconstruction. The goal is to recapitulate part of the work done by
the Seung Lab for the MICrONS program: neuron cell reconstruction via
CNNs. The tool chosen to base this work on is Seung Lab's
chunkflow. The novel part is that chunkflow will need to be deployed in a
serverless friendly manner.

*** The Seung Lab
  :PROPERTIES:
  :UNNUMBERED: notoc
  :END:

The Seung Lab at Princeton is one of (if not the) best places for
research applying CNNs to connectomics. It seems the lab has been at
it [[https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2017/09/11/using-artificial-intelligence-to-map-the-brains-wiring/][since around 2006]]. The lab puts out a lot of software for
connectomic data processing. Most of it is open source, and a good
deal of that is licensed in a commercially friendly way (Apache, MIT,
BSD, etc.).

Seung Lab did the reconstruction work for the MICrONS program.
Chunkflow is their latest reconstruction application for running 3D
CNNs at scale. It is currently unknown if chunkflow was used during
MICrONS. [ *TODO:* doubt it. Wasn't that 2D segmentation? Or is that still what is done in 

Nonetheless, chunkflow seems like a good place to start. The goal is
to fold some Seung Lab code into Cuboids so that it has all the
functionality needed to perform the MICrONS work. There is no reason
not to use the latest and greatest. Cuboids is not a recreation to be
put in a theoretical MICrONS museum.

*** CNN inference on Lambda
  :PROPERTIES:
  :UNNUMBERED: notoc
  :END:  

Before getting into the specifics of Chuckflow, it is worth discussing
whether CNN code can be run on AWS Lambda at all. Currently inference
tasks can be run on Lambda. Actually training models is out of scope
for this task but that may eventually be added to Cuboids.
  
In 2015, the limitations of AWS Lambda were too tight to accommodate
many code packages which include machine learning libraries, say,
scikit-learn. This is another valid reason why image processing was
performed external to the Boss. 

In the interim, AWS Lambda -- the core technology of serverless -- has
matured such that [[https://medium.com/@adhorn/getting-started-with-aws-lambda-layers-for-python-6e10b1f9a5d][larger Python codebases can now be deployed on
Lambda]]. For example, [[https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-sklearn-machine-learning-on-aws-lambda-with-sam-8cc69ee04f47][scikit-learn can now be deployed on AWS
Lambda]]. By packaging popular ML frameworks as [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html][Lambda layers]], Cuboids
can be a serverless platform for 3D image recognition within a
bossDB-based system.

The TensorFlow Lite inference runtime can be [[https://www.edeltech.ch/tensorflow/machine-learning/serverless/2020/07/11/how-to-deploy-a-tensorflow-lite-model-on-aws-lambda.html][packaged for Lambda]] in
under 25 MB. Currently, the Lambda deployment package size limit is 50 MB
(zipped, for direct upload).  A maximum of 5 layers is allowed but all
5 layers, unzipped, must fit in 250 MB.

[[https://segments.ai/blog/pytorch-on-lambda][Deploying PyTorch on AWS Lambda]] is also possible. There's even a package
that does that, [[https://pypi.org/project/torchlambda/15858e85600/][tochlambda:]]
  #+begin_quote
  torchlambda is a tool to deploy PyTorch models on Amazon's AWS Lambda
  using AWS SDK for C++ and custom C++ runtime.
  
  Using static compilation of dependencies package size is only 30 Mb
  with all necessary dependencies
  #+end_quote

*** Serverless chunkflow
  :PROPERTIES:
  :UNNUMBERED: notoc
  :END:

This section introduces the idea of a serverless variant of chunkflow,
which is going by the name "serverless chunkflow."

Chunkflow ([[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow][repo]], [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10489][preprint]]) is all about running
cuboids of microscopic imaging data through 3D CNNs. It comes out of
the Seung Lab. The codebase was seemingly [[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/graphs/contributors][started in early 2018]]. The
open source code is [[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/LICENSE][licensed under Apache 2.0]].

Figure 3 from the chunkflow preprint does a good job of illustrating
the work to be done. Notice that the figure simplifies things for the
purpose of illustration: "Note that the process was illustrated in 2D
for simplicity, and the actual processing is in 3D. This illustration
used 2 Ã— 2 patches, but actual processing have much larger number of
patches in 3D."

#+attr_html: :width 40%
[[./images/chunkflow_preprint_fig_3.png]]

#+begin_quote
ConvNet output patch normalization for overlapping regions. The raw
image chunk (a) was decomposed to overlapping patches, and the patches
was passed through a ConvNet to produce affinity map (b), the affinity
map voxels were weighted according to the distance to boundary (d),
the the weighted affinity map was recombined by summation to form a
larger map (e), the larger map was then cropped to remove the weighted
margin (f).
#+end_quote   

Chuckflow is a job system for processing cuboids of data. DCNNs are
run over small volumes (sub-cuboids) to perform ML based volume
segmentation down to individual neurons, synapses, etc. There are masters
(Chunk Generators) which initiate jobs and there are workers (Chunk
Processors) who each do their little task. Their interaction is
orchestrated by an AWS SQS queue.

The Generators and Processors can be any machines but on AWS are
normally EC2 instances. Chuckflow can be configured to work with cheap
preemptible EC2 instances purchased via spot pricing. This can reduce
the compute cost down to about one third that of non-spot
pricing. 

Following the serverless-first design pattern, a goal of deploying
chunkflow in Cuboids is to use it in a serverless fashion.  A
serverless chunkflow will have low impedance mismatch with the rest
of the Boss system since everything in the core will be serverless.  

Note that [[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/chunkflow/lib/aws/sqs_queue.py][the core control bus in chunkflow]] is built around AWS
SQS. SQS is a common building block for serverless applications. There
is nothing to prevent Lambdas from getting 3D CNN inference jobspecs
from SQS and performing as chuckflow workers.

*** Cache 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :UNNUMBERED: notoc
  :END:
  
Another reason to select chunkflow is that it may well work well with
the cuboids in-memory cache that the Boss has. Consider chunkflow
Issue #68: [[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/issues/68][use geohash to schedule task respecting locality]]:
#+begin_quote
scheduling task respecting locality will enhance usage of caches.
1. the queue server stored the finished locations and unfinished locations (grid index).
2. worker send request with a current center of processed grid positions.
3. the server will assign task according to the history of worker and respect the locality.

A good candidate is *redis server with spatial indexes or geohash*
#+end_quote

For example, Flood Filling Networks (FFN) on average repeatedly
visit any given voxel about 75 times.  During inference, FFNs are fed
cuboids. They also tend to "walk" along cell membranes. This will look
like a sequence of moves which keep asking for neighboring cuboids.
As such, a serverless packaging of FFNs -- which are TensorFlow based
-- might benefit nicely from the Boss Redis cache of cuboids.

*** Development roadmap
  :PROPERTIES:
  :UNNUMBERED: notoc
  :END:

The easiest and first thing to do is stand up a stock chunkflow deploy
which reproduces the workflow they describe in the preprint. Then
there are essentially two roles for computers in chunkflow, Chuck
Generators and Chunk Processors. It should be trivial to set up
Lambdas to act as Chuck Processors. That's when it becomes hybrid but not
serverless-first.

There needs to be a way for reconstruction jobs to initiable. That
will be implemented as a Step Function and exposed in the REST API.

Chunkflow does not currently work with TensorFlow, it seems:
[[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/chunkflow/chunk/image/convnet/inferencer.py#L176][inferencer.py, L176]]. But it looks like there's structure to build on to
extend the system to work with TensorFlow (see
[[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/chunkflow/chunk/image/convnet/patch/pytorch.py][class PyTorch(PatchInferencerBase)]]).  The chunkflow preprint says "To add a
new inference backend, we only need to implement 5D patch processing
including batch size, number of channel and patch size." That comment
in the preprint seems to correspond to chunkflow Issue #55 on GitHub: [[https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/issues/55][use
pytorch/dask/tensorflow for parallel execution]].

An intermediate development state would be to have an EC2 instance
running the existing Chunk Generator code. From the Step Functions
perspective, that instance would be wrapped as an Activity which polls
Step Functions for reconstruction jobs to perform. Also, the ability
to switch from Lambdas to EC2 instances may come in handy in some use
cases if demand is high and steady.

The final state of development would be to have a Lambda which is
a Chunk Generator.  This is how an external API could initiate a CNN
inference job inside a Step Function.  That would be the full
serverless chunkflow implementation achieved in stages.

This Chuckflow plan is a textbook illustration of how Step Functions
can involve both Lambda and EC2 instances, demonstrating part of their
value.

** Further analysis services

This manifesto focuses on creating a single system which recapitulates
the data processing that was done with multiple systems for the
MICrONS program. Doing so serves as a marque proof of concept.

But that is hopefully only the beginning. The goal is for Cuboids to
be an open source, cloud-native serverless, relatively easy to manage
platform for 3D and 4D microscopy data storage and analysis. 

The cache-accelerated serverless core should be able to handle
massive workflows at high speed. The serverless-first Step Functions
are a solid framework for building complex analysis pipelines.

There are obvious things that could be done with such a platform, for example:
- Other reconstruction algorithms such as FFNs
- Convolving some Vaa3D plug-ins over a volume
- [[https://towardsdatascience.com/countless-3d-vectorized-2x-downsampling-of-labeled-volume-images-using-python-and-numpy-59d686c2f75][COUNTLESS 3D for Vectorized 2x Downsampling of Labeled Volumes]] 
  - Fast colored multi-resolution pyramid building ([[https://github.com/william-silversmith/countless][repo]])
  - Colored as per the output of classifiers and reconstructors
  - Can this be cast as a chunkflow job: recursively downsampling in a (2,2,2) => (1,1,1) algorithm using the Redis in memory cache to memoize the answer 
- Deconvolution of brightfield data
- Resolution pyramids with an intensity threshold 
  - This way brightfield stacks can be viewed with the field filtered out
  - Could make this a chunkflow based algorithm
- [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.274225v1.full][Distributed proof-reading via ChunkedGraph]] 
  - Think git for neural cell morphology proofreading
  
The first item in the above list is where Google's Flood-Filling
Networks should be used for reconstruction inference.  Looks like FFN
inference phase should be parallelizable. Multiple attention heads
could individually fill separate neurites.

Finally, an example of a complex pipeline would be cell type
classification via Convolutional Morphology Networks (CMNs, see
[[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10836-3][Learning cellular morphology with neural networks]]. This too is Seung
Lab work so should hopefully work well with chunkflow. On a high
level, first cell surface meshes are generated via reconstruction
inference (via FFN), then they are classified by cell type. For
example, they trained a CMN to classify as glia or not. Glia comprise
about 90% of the cells and filtering them out allows attention to
focus on the more interesting neurons. A second generation of this
would involve using the Allens Cell Types Database to classify each
IDs neuron by type.

Neuron2Vec is triple-loss based unsupervised (no labeling required)
learning of cell morphologies (analogously to human bodies: locally,
fingers look different from arms and arms from bodies). This would
make for a valuable t-SNE/UMAP 2D image mapping of neuron segments;
maybe throw in some HDBSCAN clustering.  Use the top three principle
components to define a voxel's RGB color. This illustrates how novel
UI features can be added by multi-step analysis pipelines, which would
be implemented as a Step Function.

[[./images/cmn.png]]

* Conclusion

This document is a roadmap for development. This plan has been drawn
up before the start of coding. As per von Moltke, no plan survives
first contact with the enemy. Additionally, there are still open
questions, for example, what to do about [[https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/docs/InstallGuide.md#configure-scalyr-account][the Scalyr logging]]; the
[[https://www.serverless.com/][Serverless Framework]] is already in the mix but perhaps that should be
migrated to AWS SAM. The next phase, i.e. actually deploying a stock
bossDB, is to be documented in ~boss_deploy_log.org~. Surely that will
surface more issues.

The Boss has proven itself. A serverless architecture works well for
connectomics data. In 2017 AWS was promoting the Boss as a poster
child for serverless. The time is right to move the Boss back to the
edge of the envelope and into the future.
