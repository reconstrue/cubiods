<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This document proposes refresh modifications and novel extentions to
the bossDB volumentric database. The envisioned platform has been
given the working title of Cuboids.
</p>

<p>
During the MICrONS program, the bossDB (a.k.a., "the Boss") code has
proven to scale to petabytes of data. This is very impressive as it is
unusual for a codebase to be so extremely stress tested in its initial
deployment. In order to position the Boss to be the open source core
backend repository for the next generation of neuroscientific
experiments, the codebase should be streamlined for ease of
administration and to address feedback from the original users.
</p>

<p>
The initial goal of the Cuboids project is an architectural update of
bossDB to leverage the latest AWS serverless innovations thereby
simplifying deployment and maintenance of the existing system, while
maintaining the existing bossDB surface APIs. The subsequent goal is
to use the streamlined bossDB as the repository component of a cloud
service which can do more than just store and visualize data.
</p>

<p>
The resulting Cuboids platform is to be a "whole product" which
recapitulates the multi-system architecture of the MICrONS project but
with all tasks &#x2013; storage, analysis, visualization, etcetera &#x2013;
performable within a Cuboids instance. The first process to be moved
into Cuboids is the code used during MICrONS for reconstruction of
neurons via image recognition machine learning inference. After that
the system will be an agile platform for further innovations. Examples
include inference by Google's Flood Filling Networks, training machine
learning models, and classification by cell type.

<h2 id="org2410ceb"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The <a href="https://bossdb.org/">bossDB</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_rendering">volumetric</a> database capable of storing petabytes of
data generated from microscopic imaging of neurological
tissue. Colloquially, bossDB is also known as "the Boss" and in this
document both terms are interchangable. 
</p>

<p>
Initial development of the Boss was funded via grants from <a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/">IARPA</a> under
<a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/microns">the MICrONS project</a>. The resulting source code &#x2013; spanning multiple
repositories &#x2013; is available under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0</a> open source license.
</p>

<p>
The modified bossDB codebase proposed herein is designed to be the
repository component of a platform which has been given the working
title of Cuboids. Cuboids builds atop existing work by doubling down
on the current AWS lock-in of bossDB, in the interests of streamlining
the architecture in order to make it easier to administer. This part
of the proposal is simply "better, faster, cheaper" thinking which
does not change the high-level feature set of the repository.
</p>

<p>
The original bossDB codebase evidences a valid and shrewd
architectural style which values vendor neutral open source. Yet to
deal with the sporatic, massive volume and velocity of data being
throw off by electron microscopes, an AWS serverless engine was
adopted. This worked well but resulted in a mixed architectural style
which is more complex than currently necessary.  Cuboids aims to
resolve the complexity by going all-in on AWS lock-in by jettisoning
any existing components which can be replaced by equivalent fully
managed AWS services.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the aforementioned architectural refresh, Cuboids aims to build
significant analysis functionality close around the repository. Given
the current architecture of the Boss, image analysis has to be
performed by separate external systems, requiring the transfer of
mountains of data. Cuboids builds on the previous bossDB work such
that analysis of the data within a bossDB repository can be performed
close to where the data resides.
</p>

<p>
This functional expansion can be accomplished by shepparding the
existing serverless boosted architecture towards a serverless-first
design. In 2015, when work on the Boss was started, a serverless-first
architecture simply could not be build because AWS has not yet built
out enough serverless products. The term "serverless-first" refers in
part to the minimizing of self-managed services. More importantly, the
balance is to swing from the current Boss architecture of a
non-serverless frame with a serverless engine to one which builds out
from the serverless core and then adds on long running, self-managed
compute instances only as necessited by technical or financial
concerns.
</p>

<p>
Peta-scale datasets are unlikely to ever migrate from where they are
initially reposited. Recognizing this and the fact that the existing
AWS-only codebase is currently managing petabytes of data in AWS, this
manifesto accepts the reality of single vendor lock-in with regards to
cloud provider platform and so drinks deeply from the AWS Kool-Aid
pitcher by moving towards less servers and more fully managed
services.

The Boss was written to be the repository for data generated by the
MICrONS program. The data consists of videos, static images, and the
results of machine learning based analysis of the movies and images.

<p>
Tersely, the Boss &#x2013; created by JHU/APL &#x2013; was used in both Phase One
and Phase Two of MICrONS. Phase One was a "small" trail run of the
main task which occurred in Phase Two. The resulting EM image sets
were 40 terabyte versus 2.5 petabyte, respectively, a ratio of
1:62. Phase One involved three separate groups of organizations
competitively trying out to be awarded the grant for the Phase Two
work.  The winning team which moved on to Phase Two consisted of <a href="https://alleninstitute.org/">The
Allen Institute</a>, <a href="https://seunglab.org/">the Seung Lab at Princeton University</a>, and <a href="https://toliaslab.org/">the Tolias
Lab</a> at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.
</p>

<p>
The technical architecture of the data system of the MICrONS project
centers around the Boss. The design enabled coordination across the
organizations participating in MICrONS.  The following diagram
illustrates part of the flow of data in and out of the Boss repository
during Phase Two.

<p>
Four organization each focused on their particular area of expertise:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>JHU/APL wrote the Boss repository code and supporting tools</li>
<li>Baylor University performed functional imaging experiments on a live mouse</li>
<li>The Allen Institute electron microscope (EM) scanned that mouse's brain</li>
<li>The Seung Lab wrote the machine learning code to reconstruct the imaged neurons</li>
</ul>

<p>
The functional calcium imaging generated many 4D movies of neural activities
taken while the mouse was performing in various learning experiments.
Next the structural imaging involved scanning a cubic millimeter of
the mouse's brain via a industrialized EM workflow which generated 2.5
petabyte of TIFF image files. (The distinction between structural
imaging and functional imaging is analogous to that between the map of
a road network and recordings of traffic over the network,
respectively.) Finally, the reconstruction work involved downloading
the EM images and mining them via custom built machine learning
algorithms &#x2013; deep CNNs navigating through massive volumes of 3D data
to recognize neurons down to indiviual synapses. (Not shown here is the
work of coregistering the functional calcium videos to the EM structural data.)

such reconstruction algorithms do. The colored map on the 2D plane

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
The docs describe the Boss as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Boss is a large-scale spatial database service for storing
multi-dimensional neuroimaging data and associated voxel annotations
that was created for the IARPA MICrONS program. The database is
designed to support three dimensional, multi-channel, and time series
source data and annotations at various bit depths. The Boss was
designed to live in the cloud and has a tiered storage architecture to
balance cost and performance, auto-scaling capabilities, and a
high-bandwidth ingest process.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In its current form the Boss architecture can be considered a hybrid
of two styles. The foundational frame consists of non-serverless,
platform neutral, open source machinery originally assembled for the
NeuroData project. The JHU/APL developers were already familiar with
these solid technologies and it made sense to reapply them in the Boss
codebase. Within that frame was built out a turbo boosted engine of serverless
tech. These decisions were made for valid reasons back in 2015 and time has
shown the resulting codebase has served its original purpose well.
</p>

<p>
The following diagram is from the original bossDB pre-print. In order
to break it down, the yellow and red backgound boxes with labels in
bold have been added as annotations. The yellow box highlights the
serverless core of the architecture.  The red boxes define three
non-serverless sub-systems which were built out of platform neutral,
open source machinery. The colors were chosen to correspond to the
argument presented in later sections: keep the yellow, jettison the
red.
</p>


<div id="orgf7fa4a5" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/bossdb_delta_components.png" alt="bossdb_delta_components.png" width="75%" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The core engine of BossDB is the spatial database, repo name
<a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb">jhuapl-boss/spdb</a>. This service features the usual suspects found in
AWS severless machines: Lambda, S3, SQS, DynamoDB, Step Functions,
etc.
</p>


<p>
The other three sub-systems in red are proven non-serverless, open
source technologies: Bastion, Vault, Keycloak, etc.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The upper left red zone is the REST interface</li>
<li>The Single Sign-on subsystem is in the upper right red zone</li>
<li>The lower reg zone can be replace with AWS Secrets Manager</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those three sub-systems are not particularly interesting, domain
specific machinery. Nonetheless, the functionality they provide
amounts to table stakes for a modern, mature application. In AWS
marketing terminology they are <a href="https://jeremybower.com/articles/undifferentiated-heavy-lifting-2-0.html">"undifferentiated heavy lifting"</a>
support machinery. JHU/APL simply reapplied solid codebases they were
already familiar with while getting on with the task of building a
petascale volumetric spatial database.
</p>

<p>
Sundry adopted AWS services are enumerated in the bottom dash boxed
region. These services are applicable to both serverless and container
based architectures and will be kept in Cuboids.
</p>

<p>
Note: the hybrid nature of the Boss architecture is not a result of
the multi-team social structure of the MICrONS program. On the other
hand, the fact that the original Boss cannot perform image recognition
internally is indeed a reflection of the social structure. The
decisions which lead to this state can be seen as a wisely chosen
limiting of the scope of development for the initial Boss. But, as
will be argued herein, it is time to change that.
</p>

<p>
From an external perspective, the resulting architectural structure is
still sound. Cuboids will maintain the existing Boss HTTP APIs to the
repository component and only modify its internal structure. Thereby
analysis tools written atop Cuboids will be able to interface with
multiple bossDB repositories, including the one wherein the MICrONS
data resides.

<p>
Significant but non-core parts of the bossDB codebase (the red boxes
in the previous diagram) are simply deployments of existing open
source components which just so happens to be platform neutral,
non-serverless tech. Vendor neutrality is a good thing but Cuboids
consciously jettisons that feature in the interests of accellerating
innovation via improved developer velocity and reduced devops
workload. Perfectly good open-source component of the Boss will be
replaced with equivalent AWS fully managed services.
</p>

<p>
This document is entitled "The Cuboids Manifesto" in reference to the
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1AiBi5gf1s">manifesto</a>" documents that circulate within the Swift programming
community (and it is a bit long). This type of document serves the
purpose of introducing a proposal which is larger in scope than a
single, small, specific proposal. This document follows that
lighthearted nomenclature, in order to highlight that there is a
<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2012/08/16/realtechnik-nausea-and-technological-longing/">realtechnik</a> "philosophy" driving the decisions behind what is proposed
herein.
</p>

<p>
There are two main assumptions to the argument:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The original Boss codebase can only be deployed on AWS</li>
<li>Very large datasets (in particular, the MICrONS data on AWS) are rather immobile</li>
</ul>

<p>
As to the former assumption, normally it is ideal if open source code
is platform vendor neutral. Yet falling short of such ideals there are
still benefits to the open source way, for example, innovation shared
throughout a community of users. The Boss, given its AWS serverless
engine, is very much not vendor neutral.  For example, the Boss makes
use of AWS Step Functions. Unfortunately there is currently no
equivalent abstraction available which works on other cloud platforms
(which seems odd but c'est la vie).
</p>

<p>
Given the AWS technologies already adopted in the bossDB codebase,
Cuboids accepts and runs with the reality of AWS lock-in, probably in
perpetuity. It is arguably a bit perverse for open source to be tuned
up just for a single commercial cloud platform, but the hypothesis
herein is that by doing so it will make it much easier for other
organizations to deploy BossDB, thereby speeding up the diffusion of
innovation.
</p>

<p>
The latter assumption acknowledges the inertia of peta-scale
datasets. The MICrONS data is already in AWS S3. Other smaller
datasets are also accreting in Boss deploys on AWS. So code
which analyzes these datasets yet only runs on AWS is not a major
negative. Of course, this too is gradually leading to more AWS lock
in. Other cloud vendors are missing out on an emerging industry
sector. Obviously it is not the biggest sector in terms of users but this
is heading towards exo-scale datasets which is not insignificant.
</p>

<p>
Datasets on such a scale as that of the MICrONS data form a
gravitational well inducing system architectures wherein data
processing happens as close to the data as possible; it is desirable
to minimise massive data trasfers. Although the existing bossDB APIs
can be used to fetch raw data for analysis on systems external to the
Boss, Cuboids intends to extend the Boss platform such that data
analysis can be performed within the system. Quoting Francis Bacon:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mahomet cald the Hill to come to him. And when the Hill stood still,
he was neuer a whit abashed, but said; If the Hill will not come to
Mahomet, Mahomet wil go to the hil. [sic]
</p>
</blockquote>


<div id="org4867f40" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/mohammed_and_the_mountain.jpg" alt="mohammed_and_the_mountain.jpg" width="400px" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The two above assumptions drive the logic of this document. This
proposal argues to dive headlong down the slippery slope of AWS
lock-in. This recommended direction may seem counterintuitive and even
distasteful given the platform vendor neutral, open source ecosystem
out of which the Boss grew.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, although the technological lead which AWS currently
enjoys over the other cloud platform vendors <a href="https://cloudwars.co/amazon/inside-amazon-aws-no-longer-jeff-bezos-growth-engine/">is slipping</a>, it does not
appear that a cross-platform serverless version of bossDB is possible
at this time, given the state of those cloud platform offerings
competing with AWS (e.g. a lack of an AWS Step Functions equivalent
for Google Cloud Platform).
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it is argued herein that the mixed architecture is
retarding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">diffusion of innovation</a>, especially with regards to that
theory's criteria of "complexity" and "trialability." So, perhaps we
should just accept that this codebase will always be locked in to AWS
and drink their Kool Aid in order to lighten the load.
</p>

<p>
As a reality check on this AWS serverless enthusiasm, there is a
decent 2020-10 article, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-stalled/">Why the Serverless Revolution Has Stalled</a>,
which enumerates situations where serverless is not yet living up to
its promise. The Boss as a use case of serverless technology actually
passes almost all the checkpoints enumerated in that article: for
example, all the code is written in Python (i.e. a language well
supported by AWS Lambda), it is greenfield, and the entire app was
explicitly designed to run on a cloud platform from the get go. The
single concern raised which the Boss is guilty of vendor lock-in but
as argued herein, that is acknowledged and accepted.
</p>

<p>
So, the Cuboids code will be very locked to AWS as the vendor
platform, which is a rather ironic form of open source. It is assumed
that these changes to bossDB are significantly disruptive enough that
PRs back to bossDB would not be worth the hassle to the repo's
maintainers. But maybe some chuncks of code will go upstream, say, the
heaviside replacement code. Perhaps upstream would be interested in
the Step Function that works with chunkflow for neuron reconstruction;
being novel that part would not involve major changes to existing code
but that could be seen as feature creap. Regardless, the Cuboids
codebase will remain open source, intentionally maintaining the Apache
2.0 license is the hopes of building an community around the codebase.

<h2 id="orgab979b2"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Architectural updates</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The first stage of Cuboids development is to be an architectural
refresh of the existing Boss codebase. 
</p>

<p>
The bossDB codebase was <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss/graphs/contributors">started in 2015</a>, which was early days for AWS
serverless, nevermind using such young technology to scale to
petabytes of data. In the interim, Lambda has become more
sophisticated and AWS has gotten around to providing
more fully managed services such as API Gateway, Cognito, and AWS
Secrets Manager. The life of a Boss administrator could involve less
hassles if the Boss were to adopt those innovations.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org451b453" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org451b453"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Overview</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
The architectural refresh is motivated by abstract goals and those
resolve to a set of specific coding tasks.  The abstract goals are to
effect the following changes.
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<td class="org-left">More fully managed services</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">Complex deployment</td>
<td class="org-left">Simplified deployment</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The main goal of the architectural refresh is to reduce the complexity
resulting from the hybrid architecture by moving towards a
serverless-first architecture. Most of the specific coding tasks
revolve around replacing self-managed sub-systems with equivalent
fully managed AWS services. Simply keeping the current serverless
core architecture but rewriting those components which can be replaced
with equivalent AWS service will make bossDB easier to deploy and
maintain. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, another potential benefit of removing self-managed
services is that serverless costs are variable while self-magaged
services with constantly running servers have higher fixed
costs. Minimizing self-managed services can lead to lower costs,
depending on use case.
</p>

<p>
Note that the goals include <b>not</b> significantly modifying
the features of the Boss repository. Specifically, the surface RESTful
APIs are to maintain backward compatibility. Any distinctly novel
functionality to be introduced in Cuboids which is not present in the
Boss codebase will be constructed outside the Boss repository
component.
</p>

<p>
The refurbishments to be performed can be illustrates by further
marking up the Boss high level architecture diagram from earlier.
These annotations are color coded according to a stop light
red-yellow-green color scheme. The red boxes are to be replace with
the AWS services named in green. The red boxes are labeled by their
roles in black bold text. Those same roles are to be resatisfied with
the named (in green) AWS fully managed services.
</p>


<div id="org1f02d5e" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/boss_high_level_changes.png" alt="boss_high_level_changes.png" width="100%" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the above diagram, the parts of the architecture to be refurbished are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The RESTful interface machinery: to be handled by Amazon API Gateway</li>
<li>The Single sign on machinery: to be migrated to AWS Cognito</li>
<li>The secrets keeping machinery: to be replaces with AWS Secrets Manager</li>
<li>The Redis cache: to be managed by Amazon ElastiCache</li>
</ul>

<p>
These sub-systems to be modified are simply necessary support
infrastructure &#x2013; undifferentiated, off-the-shelf app infrastructure,
not the bespoke domain specific innovations contained in the core serverless
engine of the spatial database. The code to be replaced is perfectly
good code; that is proven platform independent, scalable open
source. But as pre-serverless tech it requires self management and
related infrastructures.
</p>

<p>
Besides the above mentioned machinery refurbishments there is also a
tooling library, <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/heaviside">heaviside</a>, which is to be replaced with AWS
equivalent tooling, that is, the Python AWS CDK. Heaviside is another
instance of JHU/APL banging out a wheel before AWS got around to
recreating an equivalent. Heaviside does its job just fine but the
goal here is to set the Boss up for the next ten years. While in Rome
do as the Romans, and in AWS the CDK is the way to do what heaviside
does. AWS sees their CDKs as important tools. Might as well benefit
from the freely available tooling supported by AWS developer
resource.
</p>

<p>
In the following before-and-after juxtaposition diagram, the image on
the left is the raw image taken from the bossDB preprint, with the
serverless core highlighted in yellow. The image on the right is the
envisioned streamlined and serverless-first Boss. Notice how the
diagram reduces to a completely generic serverless architecture. That
clearly illustrates the argument being made here but reduces the
diagram to where it contains no specific detail. Going into such
detail is beyond the scope of this document, which is already overlong
as is.

<h3 id="org0aaad2d"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Development roadmap</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
The very first development work will be to simply stand up a Boss
instance using the existing codebase. That will be useful for testing
backward compatibility. Surely the deployment experience will cause
refinements to what is proposed in this document. That deployment
experience will be documented. Perhaps logging that will prove useful
to other adminstrators of Boss deploys.
</p>

<p>
The root reason for going through all the following code refresh
hassles (without gaining any new functionality) is that the Boss has
proven itself. So, the more important reason for standing up a Boss
instance is to maintain continuity of value. An alternative
development roadmap could just take the Boss as proof that serverless
can scale well to the task at hand but conclude that the code is so
bit rotted that simply starting a new codebase from scratch is the
easiest way forward. 
</p>

<p>
This manifesto is not going for a codebase restart. Cuboids is going
for evolution, not revolution. Benefitting from the well formed
architecture of the Boss, these proposed changes have been broken out
into discrete tasks so that the envisioned benefits can be
accummulated in stages. This is to reduce the risk of the whole
Cuboids project going off into the weeds. So, development can proceed
as follows: refurbish a single component, test to ensure the whole
system still works, move on to the next task.
</p>

<p>
One way to test for compatibility is to have one test client which can
work with both the existing Boss and Cuboids simply by changing the
end-point URL.  The existing Boss integration test suites should prove
useful.
</p>

<p>
The following tasks are broken out into isolatable chucks of
work. Each is to be tracked as a GitHub Issues Project. The Projects
are to be worked on individually sequentially so that overall progress
can be broken out to milestones, testable along the way via
integration tests.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8e42e64" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8e42e64"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> RESTful API</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
In the color coded architectural diagram, the RESTful API subsystem is
in the upper left red zone. The code for that Boss API machinery and
schema is currently in the repository named <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss">jhuapl-boss/boss</a>. That
machinery is to be replaced with Amazon API Gateway. 
</p>

<p>
Currently, there is a cluster using nginx to run some Python. That
Python is a django app using <code>rest_framework</code> to handle REST API calls
coming in over the public network. Cuboids can come in and out,
optionally being compressed to blosc, numpy, or npygz via HTTP content
negotiation (see <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss/blob/master/django/bossspatialdb/parsers.py">parsers.py</a>).
</p>

<p>
API Gateway was originally created to provide HTTP interfaces to AWS
serverless apps. Since the Boss core is serverless it is only natural
to use API Gateway to implement the REST interface. This is an
instance of an undifferentiated component which the Boss needed but
for which there was no available AWS service at the time of initial
development of the Boss. (Actually it looks like API Gateway had just been released at the time
but was passed over. Perhaps there was a design choice of localizing
the platform dependend code to specific repositories in the hope of
someday porting the code to other cloud platforms.)
</p>

<p>
There is some domain specific code in jhuapl-boss/boss, such as HTTP
content negotiation for cuboids. Such Python logic in the repo will be
migrated to Lambdas, but the django on nginx foundation is to be
replaced by API Gateway.
</p>

<p>
It is a goal to maintain backwards compatibility of the interface with
the original Boss APIs. This refurbishment is purely about simplyfying
the machinery which implements the interface, not about changing the
user experience of the interface.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf14537f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf14537f"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> Single sign-on</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
Referring to the color coded architecture diagram again, the upper
right red zone is the single sign-on (SSO) service.  Notice the two
domains in the diagram: api.theboss.io and auth.theboss.io. Quoting
from the Boss pre-print:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our identity provider server intentionally runs independently from
the rest of bossDB system, forcing the bossDB API to authenticate
just like any other SSO integrated tool or application, and making
future <b>federation with other data archives or authentication systems
easy.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cuboids will maintain this architectural feature, that is, auth as a separate
microservice. This also means that this work can be done completely
independently of the other refurbishment tasks in this section of the
manifesto.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the Boss pre-print:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We use the open source software package Keycloak as an identity
provider to manage users and roles. We created a Django OpenID
Connect plugin to simplify the integration of services with the SSO
provider&#x2026; The Keycloak server is deployed in an auto-scaling group
that sits behind an Elastic Load Balancer.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, another cluster of servers being self-managed. This
machinery can be replaced by Cognito and some support Lambdas. The
plan is to keep the same APIs but, in Cuboids, behind the Boss SSO APIs
will be API Gateway reading from, say, a Swagger file that mimics the Boss
auth APIs, and some Lambdas that are essentially a wrapper for AWS
Cognito API method calls.
</p>

<p>
This work can be done in stages. Could start with the existing
Keycloak based SSO code and do <a href="https://www.wolfe.id.au/2017/11/05/aws-user-federation-with-keycloak/">federation with AWS SAML</a>. Any API Gateway
based auth can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-aws-lambda-authorizers-with-a-third-party-identity-provider-to-secure-amazon-api-gateway-rest-apis/">treat the Boss SSO Keycloak service as a third party
identity provider</a> (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/vzakharchenko/keycloak-lambda-authorizer">Keycloak adapter for AWS Lambda</a>). Perhaps
such code exists already somewhere. Perhaps modify or use the code for
<a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-oidc">boss-oidc</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the docs for <a href="https://docs.theboss.io/docs/authentication">the Boss Auth REST APIs</a>, The Boss single sign on (SSO)
service has about 16 methods, comprising the usual suspects of sign on
APIs: CRUD operations for users, groups, resources, and
permissions. For example, "List User" via
<a href="https://api.theboss.io/v1/sso/user/:user_name">https://api.theboss.io/v1/sso/user/:user_name</a>
</p>

<p>
Note, existing OIDC Indentity Providers (such as the one at
auth.bossdb.io with existing MICrONS data users) can be added to a
Cognito User Pool. This means Cuboids can recognize the existing
auth.bossdb.io users and can create Cognito user roles for their
activity while in Cuboids, say, running analysis on data in the
MICrONS Boss repository.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5954a97" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5954a97"><span class="section-number-3">5.5</span> Secrets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-5">
<p>
The lower red zone can be replace with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html">AWS Secrets Manager</a>. The
existing machinery is more auto-scaling groups of EC2 instances:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Vault servers maintain secrets
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/configs/core.py#L138">Provisioned via CloudFormations</a></li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
This should be a pretty straightforward migration from two
self-managed services to an equivalent AWS fully managed
service. There is a bespoke <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/lambda/monitors/chk_vault.py"><code>chk_vault</code></a> admin Lambda, the sort of thing
which can be jettisoned and replaced with AWS Console dashboardery.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd260f1f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd260f1f"><span class="section-number-3">5.6</span> Cache machinery</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-6">
<p>
The above tasks involve migrating generice, support infrastructure
sub-systems from self-managed code to fully managed AWS
services. Those sub-systems are not part of the core serverless
engine. In contrast, refurbishing the cache machinery is a
modification to the serverless core i.e. the code in the spdb
repository. Nonetheless this task is another instance of streamlining
by migrating to fully managed services.
</p>

<p>
The Read/Write Cache is part of the core engine, enabling higher
performance. It is a Redis cache running on a cluster of EC2
instances. A cluster of self-managed EC2 instances is not
serverless. On the other hand, the cache is wired up to Lambdas which
sync (read and write) the data in the Redis in-memory cache with the
persistant store, S3. So if management of the Redis cluster were
delegated to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/fully-managed-redis/">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a>, that would make spbd a
poster child for serverless. The cache manager is an EC2 instance. It
will be removed and its functionality subsumed into ElastiCache.
</p>

<p>
There will still be a Redis cluster with EC2 instances containing the
in-memory data but that will be autoscaling and fully managed by
ElastiCache. The goal is for any Redis machinery to be reduced to
CloudFormations config of supporting services used in a serverless
application.
</p>

<p>
AWS's variant of Redis provides integration with other
AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail,
and Amazon SNS. Such integrations can be useful if going all-in on
building out for AWS only.
</p>

<p>
The main code is in the <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb">jhuapl-boss/spdb</a> repo. The most significant
files is <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb/blob/master/spdb/spatialdb/rediskvio.py">rediskvio.py</a> which is all about using Redis as a cache for
cuboids. There is also <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/spdb/blob/master/spdb/spatialdb/state.py">CacheStateDB class</a>: "to implement the Boss
cache state database and associated functionality&#x2026;Database is a
redis instance." The code that generates the CloudFormation for the Redis
cache machinery is in the boss-manage repo, in
<a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/configs/redis.py">cloudformation/configs/redis.py</a>.

<h3 id="orgc585b84"><span class="section-number-3">5.7</span> Infrastructure as code tooling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-7">
<p>
Finally, there is another technology of the Boss which will be replace
with an equivalent AWS technology. Unlike the above tasks this is not
about services. Rather, JHU/APL's developer tool, Heaviside, it to be
replaced with AWS CDK.
</p>

<p>
The core of the Boss is a sophisticated serverless application which
relies heavily on AWS StepFunctions.  Actually writing StepFunctions
in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html">Amazon States Language</a> &#x2013; raw JSON &#x2013; is an ugly hassle. To
address this inconvenience, JHU/APL created an infrastructure-as-code tool they call
<a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/heaviside">Heaviside</a>, a "Python library and DSL for working with AWS
StepFunctions."
</p>

<p>
Heaviside is another example of JHU/APL (specifically, Derek Pryor)
inventing tech needed in order to sanely build AWS serverless
applications, in this case apps involving StepFunctions.  Eventually AWS
got around to releasing their own equivalent technology, AWS CDK.
</p>

<p>
So, a decision presents itself: continue to build the core high level
logic of Boss internal processes atop a one-off tooling library by a
small team or take the hit of rewriting the existing
Heaviside code, porting it to the now dominant standard tool, AWS CDK.
Migrating to AWS CDK would position the Boss to reap the benefits of
working with a more mature implementation of a tech, one which is currently
diffused throughout a much larger community of developers and with the weight
of AWS support behind it.
</p>

<p>
The decision for Cuboids is to replace all existing Heaviside code
with equivalent CDK code, then move forward atop the standard AWS
technology. AWS CDK is available for multiple programming
languages. The Boss is written in Python so it is only logical to use
the Python AWS CDK.
</p>

<p>
In the boss-manage repository, <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/tree/master/cloud_formation/stepfunctions">18 StepFunctions</a> already exist, written
to be "compiled" by Heaviside. These are to be rewritten to use the
standard tool for such things: AWS CDK.

<h2 id="org13ba527"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Architectural extensions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
The previous section enumerated various architectural updates which
together will position a streamlined Boss for higher diffusion of
innovation. Those refurbishments add almost no new functionality to
the Boss. In contrast, this section discusses novel machinery to be
deployed alongside a Boss repository. The conglomerate is to be called
Cuboids.
</p>

<p>
As argued above, for peta-scale datasets, it is desirable for the
compute of analysis to happen as close to the data as
possible. Cuboids does that by inserting the compute into the same
system as the core Boss repository, similar to how SQL databases have
stored procedures.
</p>

<p>
The existing eighteen Step Functions and various Lambdas currently in
the Boss can be seen as a library of code containing serverless
components which perform fundimental CRUD and visualization operations
on cuboids in a Boss repository, and do so utilizing a scalable
in-memory cache.  Analysis programs which run close to the data can be
built atop those base operators. The Boss Downsampler is the poster
child program written atop the Boss libraries. 
</p>

<p>
The platform is already there but it has not yet been exploited to the
level where non-trivial data pipelines have been built atop
it. Cuboids is laying the foundation for more interesting pipelines
moving forward.
</p>

<p>
This section has two parts: first is an explanation of the design
pattern, serverless-first, which will guide the construction of new
components in Cuboids. Then the serverless-first design pattern is put
to use to add neuron reconstruction machinery to Cuboids. Doing so
will set Cuboids on a path to be more of a "whole product" for
microscopy workflows rather than, as with the Boss, essentially a
repository accessed by external analysis tools.

<div id="outline-container-org23855cc" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org23855cc"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> Serverless-first design pattern</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
The core design innovation is that the architecture is being refined
and elaborated in a serverless-first fashion. This section explains
what is meant by that.
</p>

<p>
Obviously from previous sections, part of the serverless-first mindset
involves simply minimizing any self-managed infrastructure. Of course,
one must keep an eye the costs. Serverless can be quite cost effective
but when it comes to fully managed services (for serverless or not),
sometimes AWS wants way too much money in return for simply removing a
hassle.
</p>

<p>
Setting aside services, from a coder's perspective the main AWS
service than enables serverless-first designs is Step Functions, which
has already been adopted into the Boss machinery. There are already at
least <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/tree/master/cloud_formation/stepfunctions">18 Step Functions</a> in the Boss codebase. For example, the
Downsample service involves <a href="https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss-manage/blob/master/cloud_formation/stepfunctions/resolution_hierarchy.hsd">a Step Function</a>.
</p>

<p>
From an external perspective, analysis programs can be built which
call on <a href="https://docs.theboss.io/docs">the Boss REST APIs</a>. For example, that is what
happened during MICrONS. But from an internal perspective, programs
are built as Step Functions which orchestrate Lambda and Docker
container based components. (Optionally, a Step Function program can
be exposed in an API Gateway hosted REST API.) Cuboids programs are
built on the internal APIs i.e. the interfaces to the existing core
Boss Lambdas and StepFunctions.
</p>

<p>
Consider the case of adding cuboid segmentation functionality. To the
outside world the service will manifest as new methods added to the
REST APIs. Inside AWS, The HTTP messages containing Boss REST requests
will be handled by AWS API Gateway (APIGW) which will initiate a Step
Function instance to run a segmentation job. Some states will be
Lambdas; some states might be long runing Activities, say, an EC2
instance which runs Chunkflow processes.
</p>

<p>
Step Functions are programs &#x2013; programs that just so happen to have
explicitly defined state machines. Step Functions bring state to
serverless apps which are based on the innately stateless AWS Lambda
service. Any state which needs to bridges both serverless and
non-serverless processes is maintained in a Step Function. The states
&#x2013; as Lambdas and Activities &#x2013; are the program modules which get
assembled into a Step Functions based program. 
</p>

<p>
Note that "serverless-first" does not exclude non-serverless
processes. Step Functions can orchestrate both types. Step Functions
can invoke serverless Lambdas, and other non-serverless processes can
interact with Step Functions as Activity workers performing
Tasks. From a Step Function's perspective, the former are "pushed to"
and the latter "pull from." This means that Step Functions based
services can benefit from massively scalable serverless tech as
implemented by AWS Lambdas yet also work with legacy code and/or
processes which are too big or long running to be executed within AWS
Lambda. 
</p>

<p>
Another rarely mentioned valuable feature of the serverless-first
design pattern is that it allows for safety valves. The goal of
serverless-first is to build out as much as can be in a serverless
fashion based on Lambdas, but failing that various non-serverless
components can be added into a Step Function as needed. Same Step
Function, but with some state transitions driven by EC2 instances
acting as Task Activities, rather than all states being implemented as
Lambdas.
</p>

<p>
At a certain level of traffic, for purely financial reasons is may be
worth switching the compute from Lambda to EC2. For normal serverless
applications, those sort of economics start to be financially worth
considering when scale gets in the range of 10M monthly hits. But the
Boss is not a normal serverless application. The Boss is not primarily
benefitting from serverless similar to how a small start-up
might. Sure, low fixed costs are nice but the core value of serverless
for the Boss is its ability to scale massively to the demands of large
neurscience experiments.
</p>

<p>
From the Boss codebase, it is not obvious from that Step Functions can
orchestrate both serverless and server-based compute. The Boss has
lots of StepFunctions but they deal primarily with Lambdas, not long
running processes as task Activities.
</p>

<p>
Following the serverless-first design pattern, Cuboids will continue
to build more Step Functions based programs that run within the
platform.  Any new Step Functions based code will not use Heaviside,
rather it will be written using the Python AWS CDK. (Note: that does
not mean that de-Heavisiding the codebase is a prerequisite to such
novel processes. CDK can live peacibly alongside Heaviside.)

<h3 id="org3b07cb9"><span class="section-number-3">6.2</span> Reconstruction: serverless CNN inference</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
The first major functional extension to be added to Cuboids is
reconstrution. The goal is to recapitulate part of the work done by
the Seung Lab for the MICrONS program: neuron cell reconstruction via
CNNs. The tool chosen to base this work on is Seung Lab's
Chunkflow. The novel part is that Chunkflow will need to be deployed in a
serverless friendly manner.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d3bc4a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4d3bc4a">The Seung Lab</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4d3bc4a">
<p>
The Seung Lab at Princeton is one of (if not the) best places for
research applying CNNs to connectomics. It seems the lab has been at
it <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2017/09/11/using-artificial-intelligence-to-map-the-brains-wiring/">since around 2006</a>. The lab puts out a lot of software for
connectomic data processing. Most of it is open source, and a good
deal of that is licenced in a commerically friendly way (Apache, MIT,
BSD, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Seung Lab did the reconstruction work for the MICrONS program.
Chunkflow is their latest reconstruction application for running 3D
CNNs at scale. It is currently unknown if Chunkflow was used during
MICrONS.
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, Chunkflow seems like a good place to start. The goal is
to fold some Seung Lab code into Cuboids so that it has all the
functionality needed to perform the MICrONS work. There is no reason
not to use the latest and greatest. Cuboids is not a recreation to be
put in a theoretical MICrONS museum.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org51f46d0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org51f46d0">CNN inference on Lambda</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org51f46d0">
<p>
Before getting into the specifics of Chuckflow, it is worth discussing
whether CNN code can be run on AWS Lambda at all. Currently infernence
tasks can be run on Lambda. Actually training models is out of scope
for this task but that may eventually be added to Cuboids.
</p>

<p>
In 2015, the limitations of AWS Lambda were too tight to accommodate
many code packages which include machine learning libraries, say,
scikit-learn. This is another valid reason why image processing was
performed external to the Boss. 
</p>

<p>
In the interim, AWS Lambda &#x2013; the core technology of serverless &#x2013; has
matured such that <a href="https://medium.com/@adhorn/getting-started-with-aws-lambda-layers-for-python-6e10b1f9a5d">larger Python codebases can now be deployed on
Lambda</a>. For example, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deploying-sklearn-machine-learning-on-aws-lambda-with-sam-8cc69ee04f47">scikit-learn can now be deployed on AWS
Lambda</a>. By packaging popular ML frameoworks as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html">Lambda layers</a>, Cuboids
can be a serverless platform for 3D image recognition within a
bossDB-based system.
</p>

<p>
The TensorFlow Lite inference runtime can be <a href="https://www.edeltech.ch/tensorflow/machine-learning/serverless/2020/07/11/how-to-deploy-a-tensorflow-lite-model-on-aws-lambda.html">packaged for Lambda</a> in
under 25 MB. Currently, the Lambda deployment package size limit is 50 MB
(zipped, for direct upload).  A maximum of 5 layers is allowed but all
5 layers, unzipped, must fit in 250 MB.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://segments.ai/blog/pytorch-on-lambda">Deploying PyTorch on AWS Lambda</a> is also possible. There's even a package
that does that, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/torchlambda/15858e85600/">tochlambda:</a>

<div id="outline-container-org75691bf" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org75691bf">Serverless Chunkflow</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org75691bf">
<p>
This section introduces the idea of a serverless variant of Chunkflow,
which is going by the name "serverless Chunkflow."
</p>

<p>
ChunkFlow (<a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow">repo</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10489">pre-print</a>) is all about running
cuboids of microscopic imaging data through 3D CNNs. It comes out of
the Seung Lab. The codebase was seemingly <a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/graphs/contributors">started in early 2018</a>. The
open source code is <a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/LICENSE">licensed under Apache 2.0</a>.
</p>

<p>
Figure 3 from the Chunkflow pre-print does a good job of illustrating
the work to be done. Notice that the figure simplifies things for the
purposed of illustration: "Note that the process was illustrated in 2D
for simplicity, and the actual processing is in 3D. This illustration
used 2 × 2 patches, but actual processing have much larger number of
patches in 3D."
</p>


<div id="orgc4bddb7" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/chunkflow_preprint_fig_3.png" alt="chunkflow_preprint_fig_3.png" width="40%" />
</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>
ConvNet output patch normalization for overlapping regions. The raw
image chunk (a) was decomposed to overlapping patches, and the patches
was passed through a ConvNet to produce affinity map (b), the affinity
map voxels were weighted according to the distance to boundary (d),
the the weighted affinity map was recombined by summation to form a
larger map (e), the larger map was then cropped to remove the weighted
margin (f).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Chuckflow is a job systems for processing cuboids of data. DCNNs are
run over small volumes (sub-cuboids) to perform ML based volume
segmentation down to individual neurons, synapses, etc. There are masters
(Chunk Generators) which initiate jobs and there are workers (Chunk
Processors) who each do their little task. Their interaction is
orchesrated by an AWS SQS queue.
</p>

<p>
The Generators and Processors can be any machines but on AWS are
normally EC2 instances. Chuckflow can be configured to work with cheap
preemptible EC2 instances purchased via spot pricing. This can reduce
the compute cost down to about one third that of non-spot
pricing. 
</p>

<p>
Following the serverless-first design pattern, a goal of deploying
Chunkflow in Cuboids it to use it in a serverless fashion.  A
serverless chunkflow will have low impedience mismatch with the rest
of Boss system since everything in the core will be serverless.  
</p>

<p>
Note that <a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/chunkflow/lib/aws/sqs_queue.py">the core control bus in Chunkflow</a> is built around AWS
SQS. SQS is a common building block for serverless applications. There
is nothing to prevent Lambdas from getting 3D CNN inference jobspecs
from SQS and performing as chuckflow workers.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc819413" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc819413">Cache</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc819413">
<p>
Another reason to select chunkflow is that it may well work well with
the cuboids in-memory cache that the Boss has. Consider Chunkflow
Issue #68: <a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/issues/68">use geohash to schedule task respecting locality</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
scheduling task respecting locality will enhance usage of caches.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the queue server stored the finished locations and unfinished locations (grid index).</li>
<li>worker send request with a current center of processed grid positions.</li>
<li>the server will assign task according to the history of worker and respect the locality.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A good candidate is <b>redis server with spatial indexes or geohash</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, Flood Filling Networks (FFN), on average repeatedly
visiting voxels about 75 times.  During inference, FFNs are fed
cuboids. They also tend to "walk" along cell membranes. This will look
like a sequence of moves which keep asking for neighboring cuboids.
As such, a serverless packaging of FFNs &#x2013; which are TensorFlow based
&#x2013; might benefit nicely from the Boss Redis cache of cuboids.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgad961e6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgad961e6">Development roadmap</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgad961e6">
<p>
The easiest and first thing to do is stand up a stock Chunkflow deploy which
reproduces the workflow they describe in the pre-print.
</p>

<p>
Then there are essentially two roles for computers in Chunkflow, Chuck
Generators and Chunk Processors. It should be trivial to set up
Lambdas to as Chuck Processors. That's when it becomes hybrid but not
serverless-first. 
</p>

<p>
There needs to be a way for reconstruction jobs to initiable. That
will be implemented as a Step Funtion and exposed in the REST API.
</p>

<p>
Chunkflow does not currently work with TensorFlow, it seems:
<a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/chunkflow/chunk/image/convnet/inferencer.py#L176">inferencer.py, L176</a>. But it looks like there's structure to build on to
extend the system to work with TensorFlow (see <a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/blob/master/chunkflow/chunk/image/convnet/patch/pytorch.py">class
PyTorch(PatchInferencerBase)</a>).  The chunkflow pre-print says "To add a
new inference backend, we only need to implement 5D patch processing
including batch size, number of channel and patch size." That comment
in the pre-print seems to correspond to Chunkflow Issue #55 on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/seung-lab/chunkflow/issues/55">use
pytorch/dask/tensorflow for parallel execution</a>.
</p>

<p>
An intermediate development state would be to have an EC2 instance
running the existing Chunk Generator code. From the Step Functions
perspective, that instance would be wrapped as a Activity which polls
Step Functions for reconstruction jobs to perform. Also, the ability
to switch from Lambdas to EC2 instances may come in handy in some use
cases if demand is high and steady.
</p>

<p>
The about would not qualify as serverless-first but could be a
component in a StepFunction. So experiment first with Lambda chunkflow
workers, then if that goes well figure out how to take the master code
and shoehorn that into Lamba somehow. That would be the full
serverless implementation achieved in stages.
</p>

<p>
The final state of development would be for to have a Lambda which is a Chunk Generator.
This is how an external API could initiate a CNN inference job inside a Step Function.
</p>

<p>
This Chuckflow plan is a textbook illustration of how Step Functions
can involve both Lamba and EC2 instances, demonstrating part of their
value.

<h3 id="orga148aa8"><span class="section-number-3">6.3</span> Further analysis services</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-3">
<p>
This manifesto focuses on creating a single system which recapitulates
the data processing that was done with multiple systems for the
MICrONS program. Doing so serves as a marque proof of concept.
</p>

<p>
But that is hopefully only the beginning. The goal is for Cuboids to
be an open source, cloud-native serverless, relatively easy to manage
platform for 3D and 4D microscopy data storage and analysis. 
</p>

<p>
The cache-accellerated serverless core should be able to handle
massive workflows at high speed. The serverless-first Step Functions
are a solid framework for building complex analysis pipelines.
</p>

<p>
There are obvious things that could be done with such a platform, for example:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Other reconstruction algorithms</li>
<li>Convolving some Vaa3D plug-ins over a volume</li>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/countless-3d-vectorized-2x-downsampling-of-labeled-volume-images-using-python-and-numpy-59d686c2f75">COUNTLESS 3D for Vectorized 2x Downsampling of Labeled Volumes</a> for

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Downsampling of the output of classifiers and reconstructors</li>
<li>Color by label then downsample.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Deconvolution of brightfield data</li>
<li>Resolution pyramid building with an intensity threshold (filtering for brighfield)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This way brightfield stacks can be view cleaned up</li>
<li>Could make this a chunkflow based algorithm
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Or this could just happen client side?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.30.274225v1.full">Distributed proof-reading via ChunkedGraph</a> (think git for neural cell morphology proofreading)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first item in the above list is where Google's Flood-Filling
Networks should be used for reconstruction inference.  Looks like FFN
inference phase should be parallelizable. Multiple attention heads
could individually fill separate neurites.
</p>

<p>
Finally, an example of a complex pipeline would be cell type
classification via CMN See, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10836-3">Learning cellular morphology with neural
networks</a>. This too is Seung Lab work so should hopefully work well
with Chunkflow. On a high level, first cell surface meshes are
generated via reconstruction inference (via FFN), then they are
classified by cell type. For example, they trained a CMN to classify
as glia or not. Glia comprise about 90% of the cells can be filtered
out as they are less interesting than neurons. A second generation of
this would involve using the Allens CTDB to classify each IDs neuron
by type.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
The chosen development roadmap can be seen as leading to a fork of the
Boss codebase, because it is.
</p>

<p>
It would be very valuable and desirable to not cause a fork in the
community but it would appear that such may be inevitable. Although
the main thrust of this proposal is simply an architectural refresh
without significant changes to what the software does, these changes
touch just about every component. That might be too radical a
departure from the current roadmap. 
</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, a eye will be kept out for areas where interaction can be
maintained. Perhaps a de-Heaviside PR would be welcome upstream.
</p>

<p>
The Boss has proven itself. The power of the serverless architecture
for connectomics should not be underestimated. In 2017 AWS was
promoting the Boss as a poster child of serverless. The time is right
to move the Boss back to the edge of the envelop.
